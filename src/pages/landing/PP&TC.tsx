                    At Semesters, accessible from semesters.ca, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy document outlines the types of information we collect, how we use it, and the steps we take to 
                    protect your data. If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact either of us through the links in the footer of this application.

                    <b>Information We Collect and Use</b> <br></br>
                    When you upload a syllabus or transcript to Semesters, we temporarily process the document to extract relevant data, such as course schedules, deadlines, and academic records. We do not store any documents or sensitive data other than term and course names, 
                    along with their respective grades. If you choose to create a schedule based on your uploaded syllabus or transcript, we store the schedule data to provide the functionality of exporting to Google Calendar or 
                    managing your calendar events within the application. Semesters allows you to export schedules and events to your Google Calendar. This requires access to your Google account, granted via third-party authentication. We do not store your Google account credentials.
                    Our integration with Google Calendar is restricted to only the necessary permissions required to create and manage calendar events. We do not access or store other data from your Google account.
